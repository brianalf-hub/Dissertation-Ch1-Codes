<p align="center"> Figure 4 from Alfaro and Marshall 2019. We used generalized additive models to delineate smoothed lines to determine the type of natural or artificial selection (trait value versus fitness) occuring in each population type. Most composite traits for each type (native, invasive, or landrace) differ in pattern of selection.

Background. Phenotypic or trait evolution is better assessed when the fitness function (regressions of trait value versus fitness) and the determination of genetic basis (ANOVA) is analyzed together with selection agents, such as environmental variables. We presented a unique study in that we are the first to compare three different plant types in one experiment: native, invasive, and crop (landrace) populations. For this study, we examined the effects of aridity on trait means and adaptive potential. 

Methods. After collecting phenotypic data from 300 *Brassica tournefortii* plants, we first performed PCA to narrow down our 33 trait variables into six composite traits. Then we determined genetic basis (ANOVA), described fitness functions,  and then ran analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) on the population trait means and population fitness function slopes to determine if aridity affects mean trait values and if aridity affects selection across varying environments.  

Results. We found that the type of selection differs for each trait in each population type. We found that the timing of reproduction changes differently in the three ranges with respect to amount of aridity, and that the pattern of evolution is also affected by aridity. 

Implications of study. While we would have liked more samples and locations in our study, it is not feasible given the amounts of traits that we measured. However, we have shown that to have a strong understanding of agricultural, land management, and/or conservation problems of a target species, we need to begin by assessing how a certain cultivar, variety, or genotype will respond to certain local conditions.
